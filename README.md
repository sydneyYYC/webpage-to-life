js function for mobile nav toggle 
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_mobile_navbar - mobile nav bar help

issue with nav menu disappearing and not reappearing after nav has been clicked . 
ended up erasing the href to javascript in html - talked to tony and he said it  was just a different way to connect / call the function but its not the best way- better to add a eventListener in the js instead. leftover it was causing issues w the toggle. 


now im having issues where the toggle is automatically refreshing the page and resetting the page when clicked
