### js function loop that creates images 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-display-images-from-an-array-in-javascript/

issue with nav menu disappearing and not reappearing after nav has been clicked . 
ended up erasing the href to javascript in html - talked to tony and he said it  was just a different way to connect / call the function but its not the best way- better to add a eventListener in the js instead. leftover it was causing issues w the toggle. 


now im having issues where the toggle is automatically refreshing the page and resetting the page when clicked -- fixed , had added a link to the nav which was refreshing the page , making nav refresh when clicked 

still running into bug where if menu is closed in mobile and then stretched to full - links will disappear WILL FIX LATER

#### JS image gallery found on line 12

Using a For loop to render images
