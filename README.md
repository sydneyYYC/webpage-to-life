js function for mobile nav toggle

mobile nav found on line 11 

js function loop that creates images 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-display-images-from-an-array-in-javascript/

issue with nav menu disappearing and not reappearing after nav has been clicked . 
ended up erasing the href to javascript in html - talked to tony and he said it  was just a different way to connect / call the function but its not the best way- better to add a eventListener in the js instead. leftover it was causing issues w the toggle. 


now im having issues where the toggle is automatically refreshing the page and resetting the page when clicked -- fixed , had added a link to the nav which was refreshing the page , making nav refresh when clicked 

still running into bug where if menu is closed in mobile and then stretched links will disappear WILL FIX LATER

JS image gallery found on line 12

Using a For loop to render images

// running into bug where i can render the images but not add alt text. maybe i need to append the alt text with a seperate loop? WILL FIX LATER
